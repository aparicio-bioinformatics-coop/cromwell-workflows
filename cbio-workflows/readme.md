# cBioPortal Workflows
Workflows for modifying MAF files to be compatible with cBioPortal mutation data requirements (maf-formatter), and concattenating the individual edited MAF files to create the mutation_data_extended.txt file that will be imported to cBioPortal (maf-concatter).

Both workflows were built from scratch by Jenna Liebe at the Aparicio Lab (BC Cancer Research Centre), with assistance from Dr. Elena Zaikova (Bioinformatics Scientists in the Aparicio Lab, BC Cancer Research Centre; assistance with general pipeline development) and Scott Rice (COO of PacificEast; assistance with SED and AWK scripting).
